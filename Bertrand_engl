Euclid defined a point as: "A point is something that has no properties." From here on, the Euclidian
point is ep (Euclidian Point). The main property in further discussions is the size. I would also like
to note that I agree with Euclid's definition, but I would like to expand it as follows: "A point is a
figure, all existing dimensions of which are equal to zero." That is, a point of zero size/sizes almost
completely corresponds to Euclid's definition. But it has a size or several dimensions, despite the
fact that the size or dimensions of such a point are equal to zero. And it has a dimension, which means
that it has a property, unlike the Euclidian point. For example, a point of a one-dimensional
continuous set - a segment, is a segment of zero length, a point of a square is a square of zero area,
etc. Such points will be called nep (Non Euclidian Point) below.
Since the text will not be short, I will limit myself to considering the issue of mutual mapping of
one-dimensional figures on a plane. By figures I will mean continuous, limited in size (length),
infinite sets nep. We will call such sets Cs (continues set). From here on, sets will be called Cs,
unless otherwise specified. When speaking about the size and limitedness of Cs, it is necessary to
postulate their existence, since one always follows from the other and cannot be determined
independently. The size of Cs will be considered to be a real number Len equal to the ratio of the size
of Cs to the size of Cs1, where the size of Cs1 is taken to be 1. I will also note that as a unit Cs,
one can use not only a unit segment, but also a unit circle, arc, etc.
Now we will introduce the concept of a finite element Cs - fel (Finitie Element). The finite element of
Cs, S, is Cs which is a subset of S of non-zero dimensions.
The finite element of n-rank, frn (fel of rate n), of a set S, is called fel, which is the part of S
obtained by partitioning S into n disjoint parts, so that the size of each /frn_{i} of rank n+1 is less
than the size of /frn_i of rank n, (where i is a natural number), for i<=n, and /frn_{i+1} of rank n+1
is less than the size of /frn_i of rank n. The sizes of the elements - frn may not be equal to each
other. In what follows, since all frn are unique within S, then for them, speaking about the operations
of equality, inequality or comparison frn on < > <= >=, we will mean the corresponding operation
applied to their sizes, unless otherwise specified.
Then the size of frn:
Lenfrn = \lim{n\to\infty} \frac{lenS}{n} becomes the size of fel converted to nep, since Lenfel becomes
0.
However, I consider it important that despite the zero size, fel itself, becoming nep, does not lose
dimension and its dimension is equal to the dimension of the set S.
Of course, for any finite n, arbitrarily large, Lenfrn is small but not equal to zero.
Now, about what all this is for. Let us put in correspondence two Cs, S1 and S2, so that to each fel
from S1, there corresponds a fel from S2. Such a correspondence will be called a fel-mapping of S1 onto
S2. In what follows, we will call a fel-mapping, simply, a mapping, unless otherwise stated. A mapping
of n-rank is a mapping such that each frn from S1 corresponds to exactly one frn from S2, and the rank
of these frn is the same. We will also call n the rank of the partition of the set. Note also that for
identical mappings, such as the mapping of S1 into S2=S1, the corresponding frn of S1 coincide with
those in S2 and are equal as geometric figures.
It should be noted that for brevity, only mappings of sets of eqal dimensions are considered. However,
generally speaking, it is possible to define mappings of sets whose dimensions do not coincide. In this
case, speaking about equality, inequality, or comparison of the corresponding frn of S1 and S2 on < >
<= >=, we mean the correspondence of their sizes, according to the corresponding dimensions, unless
otherwise specified. For example, the size of a 2-d frn square, compared to the size of a 1-d frn
segment, will be the size of the side that is mapped onto the segment or, in general, the size of the
projection mapping the square onto the segment. However, it is not advisable to talk about this in more
detail, since our goal is the Bertrown paradox, not writing a book.
Now, a few more words about the Euclidean point, - ep. Now I will show that neither ep nor nep are
suitable for describing mappings. The fact is that neither ep nor nep have the countability property
and no increments or neighborhood epsilon will help to express the ratio of the sizes of the mapped
sets through the ratio of the numbers of points. In the general case, the number of points and the
length cannot be put in correspondence. At the same time, frn have this property, regardless of the
rank value and will be useful for directly expressing the problem of calculating the ratios of the
numbers frn of the mapped sets. As will be seen below, the solution to the Bertrand paradox is not at
all difficult technically. The main difficulty lies in substantiating the correctness of the solution
and it is here that the concepts introduced will be very useful. Therefore, I ask you, friends, to be
patient and read to the end.
I will dare to say that despite the fact that Euclid's V postulate works great, but strictly speaking,
it is not true. Or rather, it is true when formulated in terms of frn. Moreover, it is in terms of frn
that it turns into a theorem that is easy to prove and the necessity of this postulate is abolished.
Once again, I ask you not to rush to be indignant, but read to the end. Otherwise, the solutions to the
Bertrand paradox, which will be at the very end, will not be accepted by you as justified.
I would also like to note that ep remains a useful mathematical abstraction and I will use it in my
reasoning.
Now, let's return to mappings. As was already said above, one-dimensional figures on the plane -
segments, circles and arcs of circles - will act as Cs. Let's start with segments.
Let there be a right triangle (see fig1). Let us consider the mapping of the set Sb, ep - points of the
leg b, onto the set Sc, ep - points of the hypotenuse C, obtained by constructing segments from each ep
lying on Sb to the point ep corresponding to it by construction - onto Sc so that each segment of the
mapping is parallel to the leg a. Obviously, for each ep Ebi of the leg b, there must correspond one
and only one point Eci of the hypotenuse c. This means that:
\sum_{i=1}^{infty} Ebi = \sum_{i=1}^{/infty} Eci,
and the limit of the ratio of these sums:
\lim{i\to\infty} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{infty} Ebi}{\sum_{i=1}^{/infty} Eci} = 1
And this means that the quantities ep cannot reflect the fact that c is not equal to b, in the general
case. Only at α=0, this equality is satisfied. Moreover, to maintain the correspondence of the numbers
of points, Ebi and Eci, it is necessary to require from the set of smaller size Sb, to provide any
necessary number of points from the larger set Sc.
Thus, it can be assumed that it is the size of the larger of the 2 displayed sets that reflects the
relative size in the elements of the display between the corresponding parts of these sets. This is a
very important conclusion.
Similarly, the situation is the same with the mapping of arcs described from the vertex of some angle
α, with radii r and R, r<R, when the ends of each arc lie on the opposite rays of the specified angle
(see fig2). If the mapping is defined by dividing the specified arcs into an arbitrarily large number
of parts n, then the number of parts on both arcs is always the same and equal to n, and the ratio of
the quantities of these parts is always equal to 1, up to the case n = /infty, which means, in turn,
that the quantities Ep on these arcs are equal. But this does not reflect the fact that L=Rα, and l=rα
and L/l=R/r.
Now and further, it will be clear how the concepts of nep and fel-mappings allow us to solve the
problem of calculating the ratios of the quantities of elements of the mapped sets, while mappings
expressed in terms of ep will lead to errors.
To begin with, we define the simplest case of sets - a homogeneous set. A homogeneous set is a set in
which, when dividing the set into n equal parts, the beginning of any element except the n-th, i-th, is
symmetrical to the end of the i+1-th element.
For flat geometric figures, the property of homogeneity is possessed, for example, by segments, angles
and circles. For circles and angles, the previous statement is also true for the n-th element of the
partition, since they are closed and the n-th is not the last. But we will omit such nuances for the
sake of brevity of an already spacious exposition.
Next, we introduce the concept of a mapping coordinate.
A mapping coordinate of a set S1 onto a set S2 is a homogeneous set S3 for which S1 and S2 are mapped
onto S3 so that for any rank of the mapping, each of frn of the set S3, corresponds to exactly one
unique pair of frn, in which one frn belongs to S1 and the other to S2.
The convenience of coordinates is that they are easily divided into equal parts, and the size frn of
any rank can be easily obtained from the total size and rank, by simple division.
We will call the mapping of sets using coordinates a coordinate mapping. Further, mappings will be
called coordinate mappings, unless otherwise stated.
Some examples.
For example, for the mapping (fig 1), it is convenient to choose the coordinate, the set S - a segment
of the numerical axis of real numbers, coinciding with the leg b, and the beginning of the axis
coincides with the point A. It is obvious that the sizes frn Sb and S (coordinates and leg b) are
equal. In this case, for each pair frn Sc and Sb, given a common frn coordinate S, the relation l1/l2=
cosα is true, where l1 and l2 are the sizes of the corresponding frn Sb and Sc.
For the mapping (fig 2), it is convenient to choose the angle of the arcs as the coordinate. In this
case, l1/l2=R/r.
Obviously, for any pair of mapped sets S1, S2, we can choose any number of coordinates. Since we are
talking about one-dimensional figures on a plane, we will be interested in pairs of coordinates, since
the plane, being a 2-d continuum, corresponds to exactly this number of coordinates. Of such pairs,
orthogonal coordinates are the most convenient. We can say about such coordinates that they are not
mappable onto each other. "How?" - you ask, - "The axes OX and OY have a common point O!" Yes, they
have a common point ep and in terms of ep, perpendicular segments are mappable onto each other. But in
terms of nep, we speak of mappings as frn mappings. And given that the segments are one-dimensional,
that is, have no transverse dimensions, orthogonal segments cannot be projected onto each other,
obtaining nep - the image of one segment, onto the second. In general, one could define orthogonal
coordinates as sets mappable in terms of ep - mappings, which are intuitively clear to us: - orthogonal
coordinates, as sets mappable in terms of ep - mappings, can have one single mapping element - ep. This
is not the essence - choose any definition that you like more or give your own, without changing the
essence.
In the case of Bertrand's paradox, we need to calculate the ratio of the quantities frn both for
different sections of one set and for different sections of different sets.
Consider the mapping of the set S1 onto S2, in the orthogonal coordinate system X, Y. Let, for
definiteness, we are talking about the Cartesian coordinate system. Accordingly, let the functions Y1
(x)=S1(x) and Y2(x)=S1(x) be the familiar Euclidean ep-mappings. Let's not reformulate adgebra in terms
of nep, to solve the Bertrand paradox!
As we already know, quantities frn can reflect sizes, while points usually cannot. Let us imagine some
frn_s1 of the set S1. Let it correspond to a pair frn_x, frn_y, coordinates X, Y, respectively. Then
the sizes of this triple frn are related by the Pythagorean theorem:
frn_s1 =\sqrt(frn_x^2 + frn_y^2)
which corresponds to the well-known expression: dl=\sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2), but expressed in finite
increments corresponding to the sizes of the corresponding frn.
However, the main thing is that it is now completely clear that in order to calculate the required
ratios, it is necessary to use precisely the ratios of lengths along functions on given intervals. The
solutions will not be complicated, but the main conclusion is made right now and it will allow us to
justify the correctness of these solutions.
However, let us still prove "what is now completely clear".
Let there be two sets S1 and S2, including the case S2=S1. Let there be two intervals (x1, x2) and (x3,
x4) coordinates X, which may or may not overlap. Let us denote the length along Y1(x)=S1(x) on the
interval (x1, x2) as Ls1, and the length along Y2(x)=S2(x) on the interval (x3, x4) as Ls2. Now -
attention! We will not consider the mapping of S1 onto S2, since it implies equality of the numbers frn
when dividing S1 and S2, since we defined the mapping as a set of one-to-one correspondences and this
means that the rank of frn (denoted frns1) from S1 and the rank of frn (denoted frns2) from S2 are the
same. This gives us frns1_i/frns2_i=Ls1/Ls2, which can be useful in solving a number of problems, but
not in the Bertrand paradox problem.
Let us denote the division ranks of the sets S1 and S2 as k and p, respectively. Then:
Ls1 = \sigma_{i=1}^{k} frns1_i= k*frns1
Ls2 = \sigma_{i=1}^{p} frns2_i= p*frns2
In this case, we are not interested in the correspondence between the sets and we have the right to
divide them into equal parts, which means frns1_i=frns1 and frns2_i= frns2.
Now the ratio forn along the functions has a different meaning: Ls1/Ls2 = (k*frns1)/(p*frns2)
Obviously, it is always possible to choose k and p so that frns1/frns2 would differ from 1 as little as
desired. The ratio of such k and p is equal to the ratio of the lengths Ls1/Ls2 and expresses the ratio
of the numbers of EQUAL elements of the sets S1 and S2. This is exactly what we need. Neither Euclidean
points ep, nor non-Euclidean ones - nep, can express what finite elements frn express in this context.
This is because when finite increments tend to zero and their number to infinity, the information
useful for our problem disappears at the very moment when the moment of equality of the size of finite
elements to zero and their number to infinity is reached. The problem of integration as finding the
limit of an integral sum does not suffer from this, but our problem is different - we calculate the
ratios of the summand elements of different sums. In this case, it is useful to stop in the point,
arbitrarily close to infinity. This is because, peering into infinity, I feel like zero! Hilbert did
not say this. Your humble servant came up with this.

Now, boring and simple details remain, behind which is the solution to Bertrand's paradox.
Let there be two intervals (x1, x2) and (x3, x4) of the coordinate X, while mapping of the set S1 onto
the set S2, for which it is required to calculate the ratio m of the numbers of mapped elements a12 and
a34. Then, obviously, it is necessary to calculate the ratio of the lengths Ls1, Ls2 along the
functions, Y1=S1(x) and Y2=S2(x), respectively, as: 
m=\frac{\int_{x1}^{x2}dLs1}{\int_{x3}^{x4}dLs2}
Then, in the Cartesian coordinate system: 
dLs1=sqrt(1+(S1'(x))^2)dx, 
dLs2=sqrt(1+(S2'(x))^2)dx
and in the polar one we replace the coordinate designations X, Y with ρ, α 
dLs1=sqrt(ρ1(α)^2+(ρ1'(α))^2)dα,
dLs2=sqrt(ρ2(α)^2+(ρ2'(α))^2)dα
where ρ1 and ρ2 are radius vector functions of the angle x, sliding along S1(x) and S2(x),
respectively.
Now we are almost ready to solve the Bertrand paradox problem.
Now I will show that there is no paradox and the question of the selection mechanism is far-fetched.
The probability of equally probable events is equal to the ratio of the number of favorable events to
their total number, with both tending to infinity. I deliberately avoid the term "frequency", since it
will not be needed.

The first case, the "method of random ends", is the simplest and most natural of the three proposed by
the author of the paradox. That is why, on the first try, I intuitively came to the conclusion that the
correct result is given by the 1st solution: 1/3.
The proof that you are reading came later.
Let's consider a circle (fig 3), divided vertically by a diameter NS. Let S be the vertex of an
inscribed regular triangle, which is not shown so as not to clutter the figure. We will not need it,
and all we need from it is to know that since the angle β, with the vertex at the point S, is measured
from the vertical SN counterclockwise, it takes the value β2 = π / 6, if its ray is directed to the
vertex of the indicated regular triangle, located to the left and above S. This is important because
the chords of favorable events, in the left semicircle constructed from S lie in the sector β1 = 0, β2
= π / 6, the full set of chords from S, in this semicircle, lies in the sector β1 = 0, β3 = π / 2. We
choose the angle β as the coordinate of the mapping of the arc bounded by β1, β2 onto the arc of the
entire semicircle bounded by β1, β3.
The figure shows:
R=R(β) is the radius vector from point S to an arbitrary point M on the left semicircle.
r is the radius of the circle with the center O
ρ is the radius of the circle with the center S
Let us consider the mapping of the arc - the left upper quadrant of the circle S onto the arc - the
left semicircle O, SMN. As has already been said, the angle β is chosen as the coordinate and the
circle S is suitable for the mapped set (as well as for the set into which the mapping occurs), since
its frn are distributed equally over the angle β, which cannot be said about the frn of the arc SMN.

Obviously:
dL=2rdβ
dl=(ρ/R)dLcosβ = (ρ/R)rcosβdβ
considering R=rcosβ, we get:
dL/dl = (ρ/2r)dβ
from which it follows that m as the ratio of integrals is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the
corresponding arcs. Or rather, the opposite is true, since m is equal to them by definition. So, the
last calculations from the word "Obviously:" are redundant. But for the sake of clarity, I decided not
to delete them.
Of course, the ratio of the length of the arc MN to the length of the arc MN could also be obtained by
the ratio of the central angles α1=π/3 and α2=π, of the indicated arcs, but the calculations, at least,
prove that the method I proposed works, even in this simple case, since for the angles β1=π/6 and
β2=π/2 their ratio is also equal to 1/3.
I will also note that the simplicity and naturalness of the first case of the paradox allowed its
author to find the correct solution, since the sizes of the displayed sets are strictly proportional to
the coordinate. In this case, the ratio of the intervals of the coordinates is equal to the ratio of
the sizes of the arcs and the solution is correct. However, as will be seen below, this is not always
the case.
I will also note that a small program in C++ also gives the result 1/3. It numerically calculates the
ratio of the number of favorable chords to the total number. Chords are generated from pairs of points
whose coordinates are obtained as a result of the work of the generator of the normal distribution of
pseudo-random integers. The generator is from the standard library. Everything is objective there. Link
to the code - https://github.com/IgorPolozov/Bertrand/new/main.

Let's move on to the second case of the paradox, - the "random radius method", - (fig 4). In defense of
this method I could only say that since the upper semicircle is reflected on its diameter symmetrically
relative to the vertical axis of symmetry of the circle, then, it would seem, the full rights of all
chords in the full set are observed. The set of chords - favorable events, also seems symmetrical
relative to the specified axis, since it lies on the interval -r / 2, +r / 2. That is, due to the
specified "symmetries", the equality of all favorable and unfavorable events is observed.
Unfortunately, these arguments lack rigor and now I will present a rigorous proof that the 2nd version
of the solution to the paradox with the result of 1/2 is an incorrect solution and I will use for this
my monstrous, but perhaps not sufficiently fully and accurately presented theory. The fact is that
despite the fact that the segments of their domain of definition of the function on the OX axis are
equal, they cannot be used to calculate the ratios of the number frn. The numbers frn for finding
ratios are specified by sets, where the sets frn are larger. In the arc of a semicircle there are
always more of them than in the segment of the diameter on which this arc rests. That is, the lengths
of the segments of the radius do not express the sum of the elements of the mapping frn, arcs of a
circle on each other. But the ratio of the lengths of the arcs - does!
As stated earlier, the ratio of the quantities frn is specified not by the ratio of the sizes of the
intervals of coordinates, but by the ratio of the lengths along the functions on these intervals,
because it is the ratio of these lengths that corresponds to the ratio of the number frn on them.
Therefore, based on the fact that the ratio of the lengths of the arcs is equal to the ratio of their
angles, then since: α1 = π / 6 and α2 = π / 2, then their ratio is equal to the ratio of the number of
vertices of the chords of favorable outcomes, to the number of vertices of the full set of outcomes:
1/3.
"So simple?!" - those who had the patience to read to this line will ask. Yes, now it is simple. Be
patient, friends, there is not much left.

Let's move on to the last, 3rd case of the paradox - "the method of random centers" (fig. 5). I will
immediately stipulate that this case requires the definition of 2-d frn and 2-d nep, since nep (Non
Euclidian Point), as part of a circle, is an element of the plane. My "theory" contains attempts at
reasoning concerning 1-d frn, which are finite elements of one-dimensional figures. But the general
approach is applicable to frn, of any dimension, and even allows one to build reasoning for mapping
sets of different dimensions onto each other, but I will not prove this here. I am not a professional
mathematician and writing a scientific work, the size of a book, is not my task. Although, if there was
funding, I would try to do this in the company of a decent mathematician. But let's move from lyrics to
business. The problem is most easily solved in polar coordinates. Angle α is the angle measured
clockwise from the radius of the circle - OR, drawn horizontally. The differential of the area of the
circle - dP, we will consider a ring with an internal radius ρ and an external radius ρ + dρ. The
differential of the area ds, corresponding to the finite element - 2-d frn of the circle will be formed
by this ring and a small angle dα obtained by rotating OR. This frn contains a 2-d nep point M, which
we will map onto a larger circle using the chord AB. Of course, this chord is tangent to the circle,
radius ρ and since the initial value α = 0, it is directed vertically. It is also obvious that the
problem of calculating the favorable and total numbers of events is reduced to obtaining the value of
the double integral, over the angle α and radius ρ. Since the case is very simple, we will do this in
our minds. Let G(ρ,α) be the probability distribution function of obtaining chords, favorable events,
on a large circle. Let us calculate the probability m at α=const, using G(ρ) at α=const:
m_ρ=\int_{0}^{R}G(ρ)}dρ
As can be seen from the figure, the problem of calculating this integral over the radius is completely
reduced to the second case of the paradox, since all chords, being tangent to the circle of radius ρ,
are perpendicular to the radius ρ and are divided by it in half. That is, the desired integral is equal
to 1/3.
And the outer integral - rotation over α cannot change this value in any way, just as in the second
case of the paradox. Total - the result: 1/3.

Friends, I apologize for the imperfections of this text, but I was in a hurry to publish it, given the
increasing density of drone and missile bombings of my city Odessa (Ukraine). My house is located in
the center, not far from the port (the main target). The distance to the coastline is about 1.5 km, in
a straight line. For example, on the night of July 25, we had a bombing from 00.30 to 04.30 by about 40
Shahed type drones. The closest explosions fell, very close. As you can see, even getting enough sleep
in such conditions is difficult. Therefore, accept this text as is. Please hurry with your comments so
that I can answer them. :)

And one more thing... As analysts say, this is just the beginning. That is why I decided to leave my
city and... country. I am far from young and do not represent any interest to the military. However, I
feel sorry for my inventions, which have not yet been published, but can be useful, having significant
business potential. Among them,
- the idea of a completely new principle of a rotary internal combustion engine, which is much more
technologically advanced in production, reliable and durable in operation, and also better than other
rotary engines in terms of specific fuel consumption and environmental friendliness. This idea has the
greatest investment potential and can change the face of a number of industries.
- a whole group of technological developments in the food industry, among which there are those that
have already been disclosed and those that are protectable (not published anywhere), among which, the
technology of improving (conching) chocolate, which allows you to get new qualities of the product,
being fast and relatively cheap, is disclosed, there is a patent, but it is already free for
protection. There is also an idea of ​​reducing energy costs in the preparation of sugar syrup Brix 60.
It is not disclosed and can be patented. - a set of C++ library template classes implementing general-
purpose algorithms that are more efficient than std/boost analogs. They are well tested. I have not
disclosed them anywhere.
In addition, being a good analyst who combines the generation of non-standard ideas with decent
technical and scientific erudition, I can be useful in a variety of areas, from physics to solving
applied problems, in the areas of hydro- and gas-dynamics, heat and mass transfer, etc.
I can also be useful for solving C++ agorithmic and architectural problems that require deep analysis
and/or a non-standard approach.
